# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

This repository contains my Python practice code focused on building strong fundamentals through hands-on problem solving 💻.

The emphasis is on understanding core concepts and writing general, reliable solutions instead of hard-coded or shortcut-based code.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 🧩 Python Basics  
  - Variables and data types  
  - Numbers and type casting  
  - Strings and boolean logic  

- 🗂️ Data Structures  
  - Lists (operations, transformations, logic problems)  
  - Tuples (immutability, unpacking, conversions)  
  - Sets (union, intersection, difference, duplicate removal)

- 🧠 Problem Solving  
  - Frequency counting  
  - List manipulation without built-in shortcuts  
  - Safe iteration and clean logic
